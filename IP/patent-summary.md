# UPIF Intellectual Property Summary
## Public Disclosure Statement

**Applies To:** Unified Prompt Intelligence Framework (UPIF)  
**Status:** Informational  
**Audience:** Contributors, partners, investors, reviewers

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document provides a **high-level summary** of the intellectual property
(IP) posture surrounding the Unified Prompt Intelligence Framework (UPIF).

It is intended to:
- Clarify ownership and intent
- Reduce ambiguity for contributors and adopters
- Distinguish protected innovations from open specifications

This document does **not** disclose patent claims, implementations, or legal
strategy.

---

## IP Philosophy

UPIF is developed under a **specification-first, governance-oriented model**.

The project distinguishes between:
- **Open protocol definitions**, and
- **Protectable system-level inventions** related to implementation.

This separation is intentional and aligns with established infrastructure
patterns (e.g., open standards with optional proprietary implementations).

---

## Scope of Patent Coverage

Patent filings associated with UPIF are intended to cover:

- System-level orchestration of prompt governance **prior to AI model execution**
- Methods for treating prompts as governed, auditable digital artifacts
- Modular enforcement of attribution, compliance, and tone constraints
- Pre-inference lifecycle management of prompt artifacts
- Governance-before-generation architectures

The **written specification**, schemas, and architectural definitions in this
repository are **not** themselves restricted.

---

## What Is Explicitly Not Claimed

Patent protection is **not** intended to cover:

- Specific AI models or model architectures
- Prompt content or creative expression
- Post-generation moderation techniques
- Military, defense, or autonomous weapon systems
- General-purpose prompt engineering techniques

UPIF is explicitly scoped for **civilian, institutional, and enterprise use**.

---

## Open Specification Commitment

The UPIF specification, including:
- `SPEC.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Metadata schemas
- Governance terminology

is published under an open license to encourage:
- Independent implementation
- Interoperability
- Academic and institutional adoption

No contributor is required to assign IP rights to participate in discussion or
specification review.

---

## Implementations and Licensing

Reference implementations, SDKs, or tooling derived from UPIF may be:
- Open source
- Commercial
- Hybrid

Such implementations may be subject to separate licensing terms.

Use of the UPIF specification **does not** require a license to any patent,
except where explicitly stated in downstream agreements.

---

## Contributor Assurance

Contributors to the specification are expected to:
- Avoid submitting proprietary or restricted material
- Respect the civilian scope of the framework
- Disclose known conflicts where appropriate

This repository does not accept contributions intended to bypass governance,
compliance, or auditability principles.

---

## Regulatory & Export Considerations

UPIF is designed to align with:
- Civilian regulatory frameworks
- Enterprise governance requirements
- Institutional compliance standards

The specification intentionally avoids controlled technical domains.

---

## Contact

For inquiries related to:
- Licensing
- Partnerships
- Clarification of IP boundaries

Please contact the project maintainers through official channels associated
with XWHYZ.

**UPIF is open by design,  
protected by intent,  
and governed by principle.**
