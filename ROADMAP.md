# UPIF Roadmap
## Specification-Led Evolution

**Status:** Informational  
**Applies To:** UPIF Specification v0.1  
**Intent:** Describe the logical evolution of UPIF as a protocol, not a product.

---

## Overview

The Unified Prompt Intelligence Framework (UPIF) is being developed as a
**specification-first protocol**.

This roadmap does not represent feature commitments, timelines, or delivery
guarantees. Instead, it documents the **natural progression** of a governance
layer as it matures from definition to adoption.

UPIF intentionally prioritizes **clarity, stability, and correctness** over
speed.

---

## Phase 0 — Specification Definition (Current)

**Objective:**  
Establish a stable, citable, and auditable protocol definition.

**Characteristics:**
- Canonical written specification (`SPEC.md`)
- Normative architectural definition (`ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- Formal metadata schema (`prompt-metadata.schema.json`)
- Clear scope boundaries and non-goals
- Civilian and institutional framing by design

**Outcome:**  
UPIF becomes a **referenceable governance layer** independent of implementation.

---

## Phase 1 — Reference Alignment

**Objective:**  
Enable consistent interpretation of the specification.

**Characteristics:**
- Clarifying notes and examples (non-normative)
- Conformance guidance for implementers
- Discussion of edge cases and failure modes
- Specification errata handling

**Outcome:**  
Independent teams can implement UPIF without coordination.

---

## Phase 2 — Reference Implementations (Downstream)

**Objective:**  
Demonstrate feasibility without constraining the protocol.

**Characteristics:**
- Minimal reference implementations
- Separation between specification and codebases
- No requirement for official or canonical implementations
- Focus on validation, not optimization

**Outcome:**  
UPIF concepts become testable while remaining vendor-neutral.

---

## Phase 3 — Tooling & Integration

**Objective:**  
Support adoption in real-world systems.

**Characteristics:**
- SDKs and APIs derived from the specification
- Developer tooling for validation and auditing
- Integration into existing AI platforms and workflows
- Governance pack distribution mechanisms

**Outcome:**  
UPIF becomes operationally useful in enterprise and institutional environments.

---

## Phase 4 — Ecosystem & Governance Packs

**Objective:**  
Enable community-driven extensibility.

**Characteristics:**
- Domain-specific governance packs (e.g., education, healthcare)
- Shared tone and compliance profiles
- Interoperability between independent UPIF implementations
- Versioned schema extensions

**Outcome:**  
UPIF evolves as a shared governance ecosystem.

---

## Phase 5 — Standardization Consideration

**Objective:**  
Assess suitability for formal standardization.

**Characteristics:**
- Stability across multiple versions
- Independent implementations in production
- Clear governance and versioning practices
- Community consensus on scope and direction

**Outcome:**  
UPIF may be considered for submission to a standards body or consortium.

---

## Guiding Principles

Throughout all phases:

- Specification stability takes precedence over expansion
- Backward compatibility is favored
- Governance clarity outweighs feature richness
- Implementation diversity is encouraged
- Centralized control is intentionally avoided

---

## Non-Commitments

This roadmap does **not**:
- Commit to timelines
- Guarantee implementation availability
- Imply ownership of downstream tooling
- Promise formal standardization

All progression is conditional on demonstrated need and community alignment.

---

## Status

UPIF is currently in **Phase 0**.

Changes to the specification occur through deliberate revision and review.

---

**UPIF progresses by necessity, not momentum.**
